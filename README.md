# BPSS-Blockchain-based-Paper-Submission-System
## Abstract
With the increasing events of academic ethic violations, how to ensure academic integrity
has become a highlighted issue among all academic fields. Currently, many cases of academic
ethic violations happen around the submission and processing of academic papers, such as
conference papers and journal articles. In particular, how to ensure that all co-authors have
agreed the submission of a research work to a conference or journal is an important issue.
Meanwhile, how to ensure that reviewers and journal editors cannot plagiarize the
submissions under review is also an important issue. Furthermore, due to the ethical rules of
academic organizations such as IEEE, authors need an open platform to check whether their
submitted manuscript contains any sequence of words that appeared in prior literature, so as
to eliminate the doubts of plagiarisms. In this work, we focus on the common academic ethic
rules, and propose a blockchain-based paper submission system to prevent from careless or
intended violations of academic ethical rules. To verify the feasibility and efficacy of the
proposed system, a prototype system is under active development as well.
